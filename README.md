For the few that can change the world but do not, for those that want to change the world but it is too late for them, for those that can change the world but are not able, for those that can change but wait to be called, for those who change the world by a little margin to maintain their sanity, for those who control the world by "right" or power, for those who look down on others for fear they may climb higher than they ever could, for the world that is infinitely beautiful but corrupted by the human condition.
